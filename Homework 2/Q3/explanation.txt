We are using the projection to project the Number of Ratings to form the y axis.
As we can see:

1. the log projection will magnify the differences when the Number of Ratings
is small, and it will narrow the difference when the Number of Ratings
is large.

2. the square projection has the similiar effect, but the magnification and reduction
effect is less when comcaring with log projection.

(ps: magnify the differences means even though difference of two number is small, but
in y axis the distance between them is large, and vise versus for narrow the difference)
